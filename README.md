# MapReduce-example
In this project, we implement the MapReduce programming model without Hadoop.

# What's MapReduce
MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating big data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster.

# MapReduce Structure
A MapReduce program is composed of a map procedure, which performs filtering and sorting, and a reduce method, which performs a summary operation.
